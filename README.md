# EX4 - Detector evaluation and autoencoder denoising
## Detector evaluation (ROC Analysis)
ROC.py calculates and plots the ROC curve of true positive rate (recall) vs false positive rate with 1-precision, from the “detector groundtruth.dat” and “detector output.dat”.
ROC analysis provides a systematic tool for quantifying the impact of variability among individuals' decision thresholds. ROC stands for ”Receiver Operating Characteristic”. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)
## Autoencoder denoising (Noisy MNIST Fashion classification)
Mnist.py is an auto-encoder that trains the neural network to encode and decode noisy images and to report different values from our network.
